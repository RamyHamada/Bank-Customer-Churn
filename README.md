 Goal
Help financial institutions understand customer behavior and reduce churn through data-driven insights and get answer for 4 main questions
1 What attributes are more common among churners than non-churners? Can churn be predicted using the variables in the data?
Churners tend to have lower credit scores, fewer products, and are less active members. Yes, churn can be predicted using features like tenure, balance, activity status, and geography.

2 What do the overall demographics of the bank's customers look like?
Most customers are middle-aged, evenly split between male and female, and primarily located in France, Germany, and Spain. The demographic distribution helps identify target segments and loyalty patterns.

3 Is there a difference between German, French, and Spanish customers in terms of account behavior?
Yes—German customers show higher churn rates and tend to be less active, while Spanish customers have lower churn and higher product engagement. French customers fall somewhere in between.

4 What types of segments exist within the bank's customers?
Customers can be segmented into high-balance loyalists, low-engagement churn risks, and mid-tier users. These segments are based on product usage, account activity, and financial behavior.
